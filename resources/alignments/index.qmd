title: "Verb alignments: precomputed data sets"
---

To simplify exploring relations among the different documents of the Complutensian Bible, we're precomputing the following data sets and making them available from our github repository.


## Occurrences of verbal forms, by lemma

Delimited-text files recording a passage reference, a lexeme identifier and a label:

- [Greek verbs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/complutensian-texts/refs/heads/main/data/greek/greekverbs.cex)
- [Latin verbs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/complutensian-texts/refs/heads/main/data/latin/latinverbs.cex)
- [Hebrew verbs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/complutensian-texts/refs/heads/main/data/hebrew/sefariaverbs.cex) (from Sefaria)


## Counts of co-occurrences of verbs

Delimited-text files recording a lemma in the reference text, a lemma in the co-occurring text, and a count.
