Significant that nothing like this in voll 5-6. In vol. 5, three sequences begin with quire `a`!
Vol. 6 has three sequences beginning with `A` (upper case)

The various segments have no order! In fact have examined 6 copies and none have the same sequence of segments for volume 6!

## Volume 1

Volume 1 contains the Pentateuch (or Torah). Its single sequence of 48 quires are identified by letters running through the alphabet twice (`a` - `z`, then `aa` - `zz`), followed by two further quires identified by typographical symbols used for ligatures in the main text.

```



## Volume 2

Volume 4:

a-z, aa-pp
corrigenda in some copies!
