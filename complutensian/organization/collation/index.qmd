Start from [the registers](../registers/)

Order may vary among specific versions.

See volume 6 discussion!

## Volume 1

1. initial quaternion. Title page followed by prologue with folios numbered from `+iii` through `+iiii`. Apparently a quaternion with a guard sheet before the title page included in numbering? But folios 7 - 8 are flipped from order in Madrid (and others)? These would be bifolios with a guard sheet and title page.  **Different content in Madrid**: verso to Prolog of Jerome has handwritten text in BNE copy!  Huntington has printed text. (This is folio 7 verso in the Huntington copy, 8 verson in BNE copy)
2. binion: 2 bifolios of corrigenda identified as `a` and `a ii`. These cover the entire Torah.
3. the entire Torah in sequential quires running from `a` - `z`, (no `j`, `u`), `aa` - `zz` and two final quires with special marks. The register on the final recto notes that `Omnes sunt terni excepto ultimo qui est quaternus`. Final verso is blank but has same red frame for planned spaces as pages with content.

## Volume 2

1. title page followed by 3 pages of prefatory material (binion?)
2. text of Joshua begins with `a` - `vv` (end of *Paralipomenon*) with the final quire `vv` having only 4 pages (a binion) with the first three numbered.
3. corrigenda in four pages, the first recto labelled `a`

Notes: The colophon to vol 2 lists all the quires of the text, but not the corrigenda, which postdate the printing of the text including colophon!

## Volume 3


- title page has prefatory material on verso, then two pages of prefatory with recto identified as `aaa ii`. Text of First Esdra continues on `aaa iii`, and runs through end of Nehemiah on `eee` 4. (`eee` is a binion.)
- *Tobias* follows with quire `Aaa`- `Iii`. *Job* ends on `Iii` 4 recto; significantly, Jerome's preface to the Psalms appears on `Iii` 4 verso.  It *must* be followed by the text of the Psalms!
- *Psalms* then begins with a reset to `a`- `p`, ending with *Songs* on `p` 8 verso (`p` is a quaternion).
- *Wisdom* resets to `A`, runs through `F`, ending *Ecclesiastes* on `F` 4 recto.  `F` 4 verso is a blank page. (`F` is a binion.)
- corrigenda. 2 pages followed by a printed blank with red frames (so a binion) with intial recto identified as `a`.


## Volume 4

- title page has initial prolog on verso; recto `a ii` has more prefatory material; `a iii` then begins Isaiah. Continuation of the Latin OT in quires `a` - `z` and `aa` - `pp` with the final `pp` having only 4 pages (a binion), the first three identified. 
- corrigenda in two folios, the first recto labelled `a`. **This is not in the BNE copy**.
- Maccabees, in quires `A` - `G`; the final quire `G` has only four pages (a binion), with the first three rectos labelled. The colophon dates vol. 4 to 10 July 1517.



Notes: in vol. 4, same spacing markers used in Greek that are used in Latin in vol. 1.


## Volume 5

- quarternion: title page folowed by introductory material; only second recto is numbered `a ii`; total of 4 bifolios, same content as Madrid
- the Gospels in continuously  numbered quires `A` - `O` (probably all ternions)
- the travels of Paul in a single ternion `α` with all rectos labelled
- the continuation of the NT from 'R` - `MM` presumably all ternions
- explanations of names in a single gather of 10 bifolios, rectos `a` - `a vi` identified as normal
- intro to Greek with vocabulary, in quires `a` - `g`. The final quire `g` has only three folios, all three rectos explicitly identified.

MM 7 verso has the colophon dating completion to Jan. 10, 1514.

Notes: `A ii verso` has handwritten variant in margin; `A iii recto` has interesting example of alignment extending even to word division! (Follow continuation on to `A iiii verso`)

Notes: spaces for elaborated caps saved and have regular lc version of letter printed but not replaced in many spots e.g., page alpha 1 of volume 2's travels of Paul.

Question: can we hypothesize that ternion `P` was planned for "journeys of Paul" but that it didn't happen and was later (or earlier???) done as a separate ternion `α` (lc alpha) ?
