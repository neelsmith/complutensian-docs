# Editorial goals

We don't need to guess what the editors of the Complutensian Bible intended: they include no fewer than five introductory essays where discussing their goals, and how they designed the Complutensian Bible to achieve those goals.



> Summary: five essays from the editors
>
> - 2 appear only in volume 1: overview of entire program
> - on reading OT appears in all 4 OT volumes 1-4
> - dedication to Pope appears only in first 4
> - on reading NT appears in 1 and 5.
>
> 2 historical surveys
>
> 3 historical documents from key editors in history of Bible
