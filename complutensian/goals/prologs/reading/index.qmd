# Reading the prologs


## Intro to Greek NT

- addressed to studiosi / σπουδαῖοι
- keep to original language of text. Originally written with no breathing or accent, so we want to keep the original form
- You can do it even if you haven't gotten *too* far!
- Still, we'll give some help: accent like MG tonos 
- NB:  this is different from our txt of LXX!
- also note: we x-index with tiny letters (indexed glossing just like Vulgate to Hebrew of OT)
