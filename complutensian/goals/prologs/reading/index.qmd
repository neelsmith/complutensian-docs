# Reading the prologs

- first time in multiple languages!
- Ut intelligas studiose Lector modum et ordinem:quem in hac veteris testamenti impressione feruauimus: ac inde possis oc libro facile uti
- 3 parts to OT, different no. of langg
- in Torah, 3 langg: must have latin for each!
- indexing system
- canonicity
- details page layout in coll etc

## Intro to Pope

- studiosus again in prolog to pope
- did Greek NT first and at same time lexicon!
- then the Hebrew dictionary *before* doing OT
Note form of dictionary. *multiplex significatio* and the index of passags for scholars!
- also need the proper names thing! (Cf text with vol 5 - identical?) Ordered alphabetically (so in Latin transcription whatever the language)
Kind of subtle idea here: proper names don't have the denotative ambiguity of common nouns so can be expressed equivalently in different scripts
- "Added to/joined to" dictionary - literally in same quire??
- Hebrew alphabet and grammar. Grammar based on Hebrew work, only the best sources.
- Best sources for texts in all 3 langg.

## To reader, on reading OT



## Intro to Greek NT

- addressed to studiosi / σπουδαῖοι
- keep to original language of text. Originally written with no breathing or accent, so we want to keep the original form
- You can do it even if you haven't gotten *too* far!
- Still, we'll give some help: accent like MG tonos 
- NB:  this is different from our txt of LXX!
- also note: we x-index with tiny letters (indexed glossing just like Vulgate to Hebrew of OT)
