We don't have to guess: they tell us in 5 prefatory essays.

pope leo: motivation, big design, overall plan
reading OT. Concrete things
(finding HEbrew roots) digging down
reading NT (1 and 5). But now apologies for NT
using dictionary. and again

- accessible to those *qui non integram linguae cognitionem adepti sunt*
- useful for innovative research: *studiosis vtillisimum fore credimus*


Things they talk about in addition to philological drive to original meaning:

- historical situation (Eusebius, Jerome) (cite others)
- design of 6 volumes
- expectations of reader


**TO POPE**

- studiosus again in prolog to pope
- did Greek NT first and at same time lexicon!
- then the Hebrew dictionary *before* doing OT
Note form of dictionary. *multiplex significatio* and the index of passags for scholars!
- also need the proper names thing! (Cf text with vol 5 - identical?) Ordered alphabetically (so in Latin transcription whatever the language)
Kind of subtle idea here: proper names don't have the denotative ambiguity of common nouns so can be expressed equivalently in different scripts
- "Added to/joined to" dictionary - literally in same quire??
- Hebrew alphabet and grammar. Grammar based on Hebrew work, only the best sources.
- Best sources for texts in all 3 langg.


**TO READER**

***NT**

**OT**


**LEXICON AND ROOTS**



We see them at work

Coming soon: an overview of all the prefatory material with explicit editorial statements in each of the six volumes.

## Implications of design

1. A library insisting on necessity of multilingual reading
2. numerous aids for beginners
3. sophisticated indexing for scholars
