The editors 

- accessible to those *qui non integram linguae cognitionem adepti sunt*
- useful for innovative research: *studiosis vtillisimum fore credimus*


Things they talk about:

- historical situation (Eusebius, Jerome)
- design of 6 volumes
- expectations of reader

Coming soon: an overview of all the prefatory material with explicit editorial statements in each of the six volumes.

## Implications of design

2. numerous aids for beginners
3. sophisticated indexing for scholars
