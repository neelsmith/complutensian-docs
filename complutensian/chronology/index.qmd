Printing Timeline:
- ??? Does Lyell say that the printing began in 1502 in honor of the future Emperor Charles V ???

It was printed in Alcal√° (Complutum) and completed between 1514 and 1517.

 Details of the Volumes:

- New Testament: The colophon (final page) is dated 10th January 1514 , making this the first volume completed.
- Hebrew and Chaldaic Vocabulary: (Part of the Old Testament supplementary materials) The Hebrew portion is dated 17th March 1514 and the Chaldean portion 31st May 1514.
- Four Volumes of the Old Testament: These followed, with the colophon of the last Old Testament volume dated 10th July 1517.



Publication Timeline:
Despite completion in 1517, the official Papal sanction needed for circulation was only granted on 22nd March 1520.

The Complutensian Polyglot was not published or distributed until 1522. What is the evidence for this???

This delay in publication may have been due to doubts by the Church authorities about the dissemination of a new Bible translation, as well as competition with Erasmus's New Testament, which was published earlier, in 1516.
