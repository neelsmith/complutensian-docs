## Important fixed points

The colophons to the three main sections of the project give explicit dates for their printing. In chronological order, they are:

- New Testament (volume 5): January 10, 1514
- Hebrew lexicon and other reference materials (volume 6): March 17, 1515
- The multilingual Old Testament (volumes 1-4): July 10, 1517

The papal authorization to publish the work is dated March 22, 1520.

Some copies include a second note from Pope Leo X referring to the death of Cisneros, which occurred on November 8 1520.[^deathdate]



[^deathdate]: Death date: [@lyell1917 28]. Lyell states (p. 35) that the authorized volumes were not "put into circulation" until 1522, but does not cite evidence for this date.
