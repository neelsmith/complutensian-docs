## A "small digital" approach

Our goal is to create  


What I've elsewhere called ["small-digital" scholarship](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-10-28-small-digital/index.html).

- small team or individual
- minimal tecnical preqequisites
- easily shared and replicated


## Pluto notebooks

:::{.callout-warning title="Work in progress"}
For each of the Pluto notebooks listed below, we are adding:

- a brief introduction
- a readable HTML version that you can download and run in Pluto
:::


- [browse images](./imagebrowsing/)
- browse passages in multiple versions
- explore the Greek Septuagint morphologically
- compare verbal usage in Latin glosses compared to Vulgate
- align verbal functions across Hebrew, Greek and Latin documents
