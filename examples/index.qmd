title: Exploring the digital polyglot

Start from our goals

## A "small digital" approach

*Not* a monolithic resources

Our goal is to create  

- resources
- applications using those resources
   - documented, replicable

What I've elsewhere called ["small-digital" scholarship](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-10-28-small-digital/index.html).

- small team or individual
- minimal tecnical preqequisites
- easily shared and replicated



## Categories

- physical organization of Complutensian
- reading texts and glosses
- morphology
- comparing contents, including
- feature alignment

## Pluto notebooks

One technology for small-digital scholarship: Pluto.

Here's a little about [Pluto notebooks](./pluto/)


Some notebooks:

- [browse images](./imagebrowsing/)
- browse [text passages in the four versions of the Complutensian Bible](./alignedpassages/)
- browse [text passages and associated Latin glosses](./aligned-with-glosses/)
- validating editing: image and text views
- verb [morphology in the Greek Septuagint](./greek-verbs/)
- aligning Latin verb functions to Septuagint

Will add introductory page for each of the following nbs

Some other notebooks available on github:



- compare verbal usage in Latin glosses compared to Vulgate
- align verbal functions across Hebrew, Greek and Latin documents
- orthographic practice: usage of [abbreviations in glosses](./abbreviations/)

Other:

- [Latin spacing markers](./spacing-markers/)
