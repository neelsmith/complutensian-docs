## A "small digital" approach



Start from our goals


*Not* a monolithic resources

Our goal is to create  

- resources: from others; our own contributions
- applications using those resources
   - documented, replicable

What I've elsewhere called ["small-digital" scholarship](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-10-28-small-digital/index.html).

- small team or individual
- minimal tecnical preqequisites
- easily shared and replicated


## Pluto notebooks

One technology for small-digital scholarship: Pluto.

Here's a little about [Pluto notebooks](./pluto/)



### The physical organization of Complutensian and orthographic practices

- [browse images](./imagebrowsing/)
- [Latin spacing markers](./spacing-markers-latin/)
- orthographic practice: usage of [abbreviations in glosses](./abbreviations/)


### Editing and indexing

- [validating editing](./validation/): image and text views



### Reading passages of texts and glosses

- browse [text passages in the four versions of the Complutensian Bible](./alignedpassages/)
- browse [text passages and associated Latin glosses](./aligned-with-glosses/)


### Morphological analysis


- verb [morphology in the Greek Septuagint](./greek-verbs/)

### Comparing  textual contents



- compare verbal usage in Latin glosses compared to Vulgate


### Aligning features

- aligning Latin verb functions to Septuagint
- align verbal functions across Hebrew, Greek and Latin documents
