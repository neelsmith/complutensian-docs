## A "small digital" approach



Start from our goals


*Not* a monolithic resources

Our goal is to create  

- resources: from others; our own contributions
- applications using those resources
   - documented, replicable

What I've elsewhere called ["small-digital" scholarship](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-10-28-small-digital/index.html).

- small team or individual
- minimal tecnical preqequisites
- easily shared and replicated


## Pluto notebooks

One technology for small-digital scholarship: Pluto.

Here's a little about [Pluto notebooks](./pluto/)



### The physical organization of Complutensian

- [browse images](./imagebrowsing/)

### Reading passages of texts and glosses

### Morphological analysis


### Comparing  textual contents

### Aligning feature



Some notebooks:


- browse [text passages in the four versions of the Complutensian Bible](./alignedpassages/)
- browse [text passages and associated Latin glosses](./aligned-with-glosses/)
- validating editing: image and text views
- verb [morphology in the Greek Septuagint](./greek-verbs/)
- aligning Latin verb functions to Septuagint

Will add introductory page for each of the following nbs
:::

Some other notebooks available on github:



- compare verbal usage in Latin glosses compared to Vulgate
- align verbal functions across Hebrew, Greek and Latin documents
- orthographic practice: usage of [abbreviations in glosses](./abbreviations/)

Other:

- [Latin spacing markers](./spacing-markers/)
