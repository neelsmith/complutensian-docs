Start from our goals

## A "small digital" approach

*Not* a monolithic resources

Our goal is to create  

- resources
- applications using those resources
   - documented, replicable

What I've elsewhere called ["small-digital" scholarship](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-10-28-small-digital/index.html).

- small team or individual
- minimal tecnical preqequisites
- easily shared and replicated


## Pluto notebooks

One technology for small-digital scholarship: Pluto.

Here's a little about [Pluto notebooks](./pluto/)


Some notebooks:

- [browse images](./imagebrowsing/)

Some other notebooks available on github:

- browse passages in multiple versions
- explore the Greek Septuagint morphologically
- compare verbal usage in Latin glosses compared to Vulgate
- align verbal functions across Hebrew, Greek and Latin documents
