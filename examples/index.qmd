## A "small digital" approach

We want to faciliate multilingual reading for all, whether beginners or experts in any of the languages of the Complutensian Bible, in digital applications adapted to their needs and interests, whether or not we've even imagined the application yet. It's not possible to achieve this with a single, monolithic application. Instead, we are assembling a collection of reusable digital resources. These include data sets already created by others as well our own contributions, and specific applications using those data sets.  
   

This approach is an example of what I've elsewhere called ["small-digital" scholarship](https://neelsmith.quarto.pub/posts/2024-10-28-small-digital/index.html). We want to encourage exploratory scholarly work with minimal technical prerequisites that can be carried out by a small team or individual, is well documented and can be easily replicated.



## Pluto notebooks

One technology that is a good match for exploratory small-digital scholarship is Pluto, a reactive notebook system that runs in a browser. On this

Here's a little about [Pluto notebooks](./pluto/)
:::


### The physical organization of Complutensian and orthographic practices

- [browse images](./imagebrowsing/)
- [Latin spacing markers](./spacing-markers-latin/)
- orthographic practice: usage of [abbreviations in glosses](./abbreviations/)


### Editing and indexing

- [validating editing](./validation/): image and text views



### Reading passages of texts and glosses

- browse [text passages in the four versions of the Complutensian Bible](./alignedpassages/)
- browse [text passages and associated Latin glosses](./aligned-with-glosses/)


### Morphological analysis


- verb [morphology in the Greek Septuagint](./greek-verbs/)

### Comparing  textual contents



- compare verbal usage in Latin glosses and Vulgate
- Zipf's law at token level
- histograms of verbs


### Aligning features

- aligning Latin verb functions to Septuagint : `alignvis-greek`
- align verb functions across Latin documents `alignvis-latin-to-latin`
