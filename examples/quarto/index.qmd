[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is a publication system that lets you combine prose in Markdown's plain-text format with executable code. Quarto can generate output in many formats (web pages, camera-ready PDFs, slide stacks...), and embeds the output of code blocks in the published format. 

We can reuse exactly the same code we experiment with in [Pluto notebooks](../pluto/) in Quarto documents.

## Quarto documents we're currently developing
